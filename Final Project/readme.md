## 01 Design Inspiration
With the increasing pressure of study and work, more and more people have no time to exercise, which leads to many physical diseases, and fat accumulation and body distortion have become one of the most important manifestations. But most people are not aware of the adverse consequences of obesity, such as impairing movement and high blood pressure. Because getting fat is slow, when they find that they are getting fat, it may be too late.

Therefore, I want to design an interactive device that allows people to feel the troubles caused by obesity and generate a sense that exercise can improve obesity and keep them healthy. 

## 02 Design Thinking
First, I need to make participants feel the impact of obesity. Obstacles to action will be the most direct experience. Therefore, I chose to use inflatable clothing to make most people with an average body feel “obese”. (In the latter part of the experiment, I found that inflatable suits are indeed very obstructive, because inflatable clothing makes the distance between the arms and the thighs hardly exist.) Secondly, I need to let the participants eliminate this obstacle through exercise, that is, let the inflatable suit shrink and restore the participants to their original shape.

To trigger the contraction of the inflatable suit, I chose to use the participants' heart rate. As we all know, when people exercise, their heart rate will increase significantly. When the heart rate rises to a certain value, it will trigger the blower in the inflatable suit to stop working and eventually cause the inflatable suit to contract.

To make the experience more interactive and exciting, I hope participants will have some voice reminders while increasing their heart rate. My initial plan was to use a pressure sensor to trigger voice reminders, but I found that the pressure sensor could not achieve my goal in subsequent tests. In the end, I chose the airflow sensor as the sound trigger device. When the blower is operating or not operating, the airflow generated by it will affect the airflow sensor, thereby generating two different sound reminders.

Finally, due to the poor sound effect of the mini speaker, I will use an external 3.5mm speaker as the sound output device. The following is the overall operation process.

## 03 Project Plan

**Phase 1:** Ensure the regular operation of the heart rate sensor and generate corresponding heart rate value and sound feedback to remind participants that the device is operating normally.

**Phase 2:** Use the value of the heart rate sensor to control the operation and non-operation of the blower.

**Phase 3:** Ensure that the airflow sensor can trigger interactive voice.

**Phase 4:** Design the connection method of the hardware, design the shell, and fit the components and the shell together.

**Phase 5:**  Test and iterate.

## 04 Production Record

**Phase 1 and Phase 2**

The acquisition of heart rate is the most critical input of the entire device, and it is the key of the device. After trying the Pulse Sensor, I found that its test value was volatile, and finally, I chose the MAX30102 high-sensitivity pulse oximeter and heart-rate sensor. The other components required are as follows:

**a. Components Requirements**

•	Arduino Nano × 1

•	MAX30102 High-Sensitivity Pulse Oximeter and Heart-Rate Sensor × 1

•	128*32 OLED display with SSD1306 × 1

•	Buzzer Module × 1 

•	Small Blower × 1

•	A MOSFET × 1

•	A Diode × 1

•	Switch × 1

•	3v Button Battery × 2

•	9v Battery × 1

Put your finger on the heart rate sensor, keep it steady (don't change the pressing force), stay for about 10 seconds, the OLED displays the heart rate value, and the buzzer module emits a "didi" sound. When the heart rate value is reached, the blower will be activated.

**Phase 3**

**a. Components Requirements**

•	Airflow Sensor × 1

•	SD Card × 1 

•	Arduino Nano

During the test, blow air to the airflow sensor until the threshold is reached, and the speaker will play the voice stored in the SD card.

**Phase 4**

**a. Solder**

Connect the components that have been successfully tested with solder, and then test again after the connection, and the test passes. 
  

**b. Modeling**

In the shell design stage, I mainly designed the hardware held by the participants, with the heart rate sensor placed on the upper part and other components on the lower part. The bottom jack is used to connect to the blower.

## 06 Conclusion and Summary

> The heart rate sensor is sometimes very unstable, which is a link that needs to be improved in the future.

> Fitness-related interactive devices have become more and more popular in the market in recent years, such as fitness rings and so on. The future development direction of this design will be devoted to the combination of the physiological changes of the human body during exercise, such as heart rate, body temperature and interactive device.
