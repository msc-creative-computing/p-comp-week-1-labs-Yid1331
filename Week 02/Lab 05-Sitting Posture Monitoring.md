# Work Posture Supervisor

## 01 INSPIRATION
+ We spend more and more time working in front of the computer every day.
+ Maybe we didn't realize it, our sitting posture is getting worse and worse. 
+ Poor sitting posture will bring us many potential diseases.

+ If a sitting posture monitoring is set up, it will remind us in time when there is a problem with our sitting posture. What will it be like?

## 02 DESIGN THINKING
+ When we sit in front of the computer for a long time, we unconsciously stretch our heads forward.
+ Just like the picture above.
+ We can remind the user whether the sitting posture is correct by monitoring the distance between the head and the computer screen.
